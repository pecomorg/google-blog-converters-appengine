The Goals of the Data Liberation Front:

  * Liberate data across web services.
  * Make that data portable across cooperating web services.
  * Allow users to own their own data which is submitted to the Cloud.
  * Do anything else to allow users to have fine-grained, easy access, and control of their data.
