This project contains a number of converters to and from different Blog services. The code is written in Python with scripts to execute the conversions either on the command-line, through a Windows batch script, or hosted on Google App Engine.

If you were directed here from a .appspot.com hosted service, please see the [README](http://google-blog-converters-appengine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README.txt) file for information on how to run the various converters.

This project is open source and distributed under the Apache license. Please feel free to add to or modify this source and propose changes or new converters.

If you are experiencing any problems with the converters or the hosted service, please add to the [issue list](http://code.google.com/p/google-blog-converters-appengine/issues/list) or ask a question on the [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/google-blog-converters).

For the list of supported conversions, see the ProductConversionsMatrix.
